# xX_Busters69_Xx
---

## Explanation
#### xX_Busters69_Xx is Python Interpreter created in Java
#### xX_Busters69_Xx goes through a python file line by line and parses that line in a Java context. After dividing the file by lines xX_Busters69_Xx then parses that line character by charcter. 
#### xX_Busters69_Xx has a unique path for each python feature that we have interpreted. This modularized approach allows xX_Busters69_Xx to easier to comprehend and to follow while running. Variables created while running a python are created in a static context in Java which allows for easy memory access for all variables created. 
#### Currently xX_Busters69_Xx interpretes the python features of 
* Comments
* If/Else statements
* Variables
* Assignment and Arithmetic Operators
* Conditional Statements
* Print Statements
